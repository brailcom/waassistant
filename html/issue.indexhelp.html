<p>
  This page contains list of all identified or possible issues found in the
  tested web pages.  Every time new location or test set is added to the
  project the list gets updated with automatically identified issues.  Issues
  marked as unhandled must be reviewed to decide whether they are actual errors
  or not.
</p>

<p>
  Issues are grouped by corresponding tests.  All applied tests are present in
  the list below, whether they contain any issues or not.  Click on the test
  title to view details about the given test.  The link next to the test title
  moves you to official test description.
</p>

<p>
  Each issue contains several links you can use to get more information.  The
  first link in each issue, its title, moves you to detailed information about
  the issue or its editing.  The two numbers separated by colon on the next
  line identify the line and column respectively where the issue was found.
  Clicking on them allows you to view the page source at that place.  Next to
  the numbers you can view the original page.
